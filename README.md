# Standalone Complex Profiler (Public Release)
### Extracting the Deeply Personal from the Ostensibly Mundane — One Cluster at a Time

This project is a distilled, publicly-acceptable segment of a larger psychological NLP pipeline designed to surface standalone psychological complexes from unstructured user-generated text (primarily Reddit). The code herein reveals how language reflects patterns — not just of opinion, but of defense mechanisms, unmet needs, latent fears, and compulsive ideological posturing.

No data is included. No users are classified. No scrapes are exposed. What you see here is the skeleton: clean, lean, and powerful in the right hands.

##  Core Objective

To transform raw textual data into interpretable clusters of psychological meaning — without relying on predefined taxonomies or diagnostic labels. This isn’t about sentiment. It’s about **structure**: how certain ideas cohere into behavioral loops. The pipeline segments users not by what they say, but by **why** they say it — linguistically and statistically.

## Included Modules

This release includes the following non-sensitive components:

### 
- , : Crafting psychological features from text (e.g., modality, self-reference, evaluative tone).
- , : Clean merging of feature sets for modeling.
- Built to be modular and stateless — works on any appropriately formatted input.

### 
- , : Reduces vector spaces to 2D/3D and clusters them using density-based methods.
- : Orchestrates the entire flow — plug and play.
- These are not “just visualizations.” They are maps of human projection.

### 
- , : Automatically generates semantically meaningful cluster summaries.
- : Merges psychological features and NLP insights to reverse-engineer a profile from its emergent cluster — with just enough interpretability to raise eyebrows.

### 
- Custom-built tools to streamline preprocessing, validate feature inputs, and manage label assignments.
- Light abstractions, no unnecessary wrappers — utility should be quiet.

## Philosophy & Methodology

This project isn't about feeding a black box and hoping for enlightenment. It’s about pushing unsupervised learning to its limits — then dragging the output back into human terms. Because if your clusters don’t survive interpretability, they probably shouldn’t exist.

Conceptually, this project leans heavily on:
- **Complex systems theory**: emergent behavioral patterns out of linguistic noise.
- **Depth psychology**: projection, repetition compulsion, self-deception.
- **NLP pragmatism**: vectorization means nothing unless it survives contact with language.

This profiler doesn't predict. It **detects**. And in doing so, it exposes — often unintentionally — where ideology, trauma, and performance intersect.

##  What This Repo *Does Not* Include

- No private data, identifiers, or web scraping tools.
- No Reddit handles, usernames, or raw post content.
- No fine-tuned models that could classify users.
- No commentary on morality. That’s your job.

## Final Notes

This codebase is a mirror: hold it up to a corpus, and it reflects structure. Hold it up to yourself, and—well—interpret at your own risk.

No user data, credentials, or web scraping logic is included in this public release.
